# [Welcome! We Do Modding Here!](https://moddingcommunity.com)
We are an ever-expanding community that is taking modding to the next level! We already provide or will be soon providing a unique marketplace, server and community browser, and hub for modders. We love the open-source community and use along with support game engines such as [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/). Help us make modding the norm and generally make gaming, technology, and media better as a whole! Read below if you're interested!

# How Does This Benefit Or Interest Me?
We are trying to make as many files and projects open-source as possible in our community without putting user's sensitive information at risk. This is because we want to support the open-source community as much as possible and with that, generally allows the community to trust in us more. This allows open-source developers, such as yourself, to contribute to our projects directly. Any of your contributions created may be publicly listed on your GitHub profile showing that you've contributed such as pull requests, forks, and general activity. On resumes and such, this can look great!

With that said, as we grow, our community will consist of many talented individuals in the modding world ranging from programmers, engineers, system administrations, modelers, mappers, designers, general modders, and so many more! We will have a marketplace for mods, a hub for communities, and a server browser for modded servers (or lobbies). Our mission is to bring the modding community together and make a noticeable positive impact to gaming with modding support.

We have many plans ahead to make gaming and modding better! These plans are detailed [here](https://github.com/modcommunity/Web-Open-Source), but we will be making a cleaner roadmap in the close feature to fulfill user expectations.
