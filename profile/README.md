# [Welcome! We Do Modding Here!](https://moddingcommunity.com)
We are an ever-expanding community that is taking [modding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSlROYETsWYlJkqM7y9J5qeHRjh6ZY6Liv0RIkxSX6EjQ7X3_kzQFkp3HNHtebks8YAe3e2QV2lBmka/pub?slide=id.g155efb98b4d_0_10) to the next level! We already provide or will be soon providing a unique marketplace, server and community browser, and forum for modders. We love the open-source community and use along with support game engines such as [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/). Help us make modding the norm and generally make gaming, technology, and media better as a whole! Read below if you're interested!

# Our Mission
The projects we're creating or improving have **MAJOR** potential to positively change the direction of gaming on a **large scale**. Instead of paying money for games where companies couldn't care less about their community or the game itself, our focus is on creating free, open-source, fully moddable with easy to use mod tools (e.g. mapping and modeling), and truly cross-platform games. This allows **the community** to have full control on improving the games and engines themselves since they're open-source, but also creating game modes, maps, servers, materials, models, and **so much more** made easier by modding tools! We are accomplishing this by implementing low-level network code to allow the most popular protocols, [TCP](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip) (e.g. Minecraft or games on the web browser) and [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) (e.g. mosted used protocol for game servers due to better performance), to co-exist with each other in multiplayer games. This with the combination of a workshop system where users securely download all custom files from servers and our server browser/discovery we've been working hard on, users will easily be able to connect to servers through any application including web browsers and computer/mobile applications, and play with others! The server browser will also include match-making and arcade systems (for user stats tracking)!

We want to bring many loved game modes, maps, servers, and so much more made by the **community** such as Counter-Strike Zombie Escape to open-source games surrounded by a community that will improve these game modes or create new ones for many others to enjoy with **zero** limitations due to open-source and full modding support. This isn't like now where the community is hoping for improvements with modding support by game companies, but it usually never happens resulting in many community-made game modes dying/not receiving deserved popularity. Keep in mind this also includes 2D games as well and our platform will also act as a party and arcade system for those categories in the future!

Want to see one example of how powerful modding can be with modded game servers? Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW4EhWVaxVw) of an old popular CS:S Zombie Escape server from ten years ago. The game is made by [Valve](http://valvesoftware.com/) (Counter-Strike: Source), but the game mode, map (Lord Of The Rings Helms Deep), player models, materials, and so much more are made by the **community** (usually all for free other than the game itself) and awesome developers from [SourceMod via AlliedMods](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=277597)! Keep in mind this game and its tools are nearly **TWENTY YEARS OLD** and have rarely been updated since then because Valve stopped caring for modding support over ten years ago! Yet, many people play this game and its modded servers more than the "new generation" of games since the community keeps making so much content that keeps the game fresh. 

# How Does This Benefit Or Interest Me?
We are trying to make as many files and projects open-source as possible in our community without putting user's sensitive information at risk. This is because we want to support the open-source community as much as possible and with that, generally allows the community to trust in us more. This allows open-source developers, such as yourself, to contribute to our projects directly. Any of your contributions created may be publicly listed on your GitHub profile showing that you've contributed such as pull requests, forks, and general activity. On resumes and such, this can look great!

With that said, as we grow, our community will consist of many talented individuals in the modding world ranging from programmers, engineers, system administrations, modelers, mappers, designers, general modders, and so many more! We will have a marketplace for mods, a hub for communities, and a server browser for modded servers (or lobbies). Our mission is to bring the modding community together and make a noticeable positive impact to gaming with modding support.

We have many plans ahead to make gaming and modding better! These plans are detailed [here](https://github.com/modcommunity/Web-Open-Source), but we will be making a cleaner roadmap in the close feature to fulfill user expectations.

# Open-Source Mod Tools
There are *no* open-source mod tools we are officially working on at this moment. We will be creating projects in the future and have plans for security and automation related tools such as an open-source anti-cheat. 

In the meantime, feel free to view showcases on our [website here](https://moddingcommunity.com/forums/tags/showcase/) that includes many **open-source** mod tools, guides, and more!

# Open-Source Games
* [Speedrun: The Game](https://github.com/speedruntg) - An open-source video game created and maintained by [The Modding Community](https://github.com/modcommunity). We are geared towards the speedrunning community and will provide modding tools for the community to utilize so that anybody can create flavors, game modes, and maps for speedrunning!

# Core
* [Website Open-Source Files](https://github.com/modcommunity/Web-Open-Source) - All open-source web files used for our website. We will continue to grow the amount of open-source files we can provide as time goes on!
